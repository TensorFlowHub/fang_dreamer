Trees : 
     A tree a asyclic graph where it has single root and its children. 

Type of Trees:
    Binaary Tree
      Binary Tree is tree where root has less than or equal to 2 children nodes 
    Ternary Tree
      Ternary Tree is a tree where root has more 2 children.
    Complete Binary Tree
      Complete binary tree is a tree where the root has children filled  left side before right side. 
    Full Binary Tree
      Full binary tree is tree where it has non single node children to its parent.
    Perfect Binaary Tree
      Perfect Binaary Tree is binary tree where it parents do have filled with 2 children at any level.

    Binary Search Tree ( BST ) : 
      left descendants <= n < right descendants

    Balances Tree 
        Red Black Tree
        AVL Tree

    Prefix Tree(  Tries )
      Prefix tree or Tries is a Ternary tree where the parent may have more than 2 children. Prefix trees/ Tries are pefect for words recommadations. 

    Min Head Tree
      Min Heap tree is complete binary tree where the parent do have less than their children. 
      Operations allowed : Insert and extration_min value.
    Max Head Tree
